I am an ERP salesperson in the agri-food sector and I sell Business Central verticals specific to the sector. I am trying ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity, and none of them are capable of doing what I want them to do. I would like to have a real-time agent that has: 1- infinite memory, so that whenever I give it cases, it will be able to detect behaviour patterns over time that will help me convert better in the future, 2- the ability to be fast.

Earlier this year we launched **mcp-agent**, a lightweight framework for building agents using the MCP protocol. Since then, we’ve been testing it hard, running long-lived tools, orchestrating multiple agents, and seeing amazing experiments from the community (like *mcp-ui* and the ChatGPT apps SDK).

Today we’re opening up **mcp-c**, a cloud platform for hosting *any* kind of MCP server, agent, or ChatGPT app.

I'm currently working on upgrading our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system at my company and could really use some input.

I’m restricted to using RAGFlow, and my original hypothesis was that implementing a multi-agent architecture would yield better performance and more accurate results. However, what I’ve observed is that:

* Multi-agent workflows are significantly slower than the single-agent setup
* The quality of the results hasn’t improved noticeably
